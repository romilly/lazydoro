# Project journal for lazerdoro

I've lost my code :(

Mu is great for beginners, but no version control!

Code is back, and working, and I have added a piezo buzzer: an LS03803 from CPC which
works off 3 v and is loud enough.

Tomorrow I will solder it onto a Perma-proto. It's shaping up to be a very nice project.

I started the project and got the Adafruit ToF sensor working with an M0 Feather Express.
